# Termite x Behavior x Evolution
Mizumoto Lab is interested in the evolution of termite collective behavior. What is the rules for behavioral coordination? How they were originated in the history of life? We answer these questions by integrating field work, behavioral observations, computational tracking, and phylogenetic comparative analysis.
