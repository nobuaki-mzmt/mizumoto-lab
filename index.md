**Looking for graduate students for Fall 2024!** <br>
If you are interested in a graduate student position (master or phd), please send: 1) a cover letter mentioning research interests and research experience (if any), and 2) your CV, to [nzm0095@auburn.edu](mailto:nzm0095@auburn.edu). <br>
**Project** Comparative behavioral analysis of termite and cockroach species to infer the evolutionary origin of nesting and social behavior in termites. See [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/i2o5ci6506qb2x6xz5dzs/2024_grad_students.pdf?rlkey=qgw7g301p90h525pgmh3v2th9&dl=0) for more information.

# Termite x Behavior x Evolution
Mizumoto Lab is interested in the evolution of termite collective behavior. What are the rules for behavioral coordination? How did they originate in the history of life? We answer these questions by integrating field work, behavioral observations, computational tracking, and phylogenetic comparative analysis. See our [Publications](publication) and [Research](research) for details.

We intentionally restricted our research (mainly) to termites for inspiration. Do you have a research question? We can answer it with termites!

Videos of insect behaviors have much information. We especially try to understand how termites coordinate their actions for collective behavior.

There are > 3,000 species of termites in this world, showing a great diversity of collective behavior. Comparison among them allows us to infer the history of evolution. We also love cool fossils.
