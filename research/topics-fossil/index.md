Fossils can be the only direct record of past behaviors performed by extinct animals. In this study, we found evidence consistent with the interaction rules for coordinated collective motion in a fossilized group of the fish Erismatopterus levatus. By inferring the next moment of the fossilized conditions, we found the traces of two rules for social interaction: repulsion from close individuals and attraction towards neighbors at a distance. This study highlights the possibility of exploring the social communication of extinct animals, which may help the understanding of the evolution of collective behaviors.<br>
